## High Level code structure

All code is compiled from here to build the whole system.

The system is a module architecture.

If you are developing on the system you need the build tools in the shared repo.

**deploy/bootstrapper**

This folder holds the protos that are used to generate fake test data.

It can be used to bootstrap data for any template.

**deploy/projects**

This folder holds example projects.

Each Project follows the exact same structure as a Template with a few extra bits:

- Deployment holds the files used for deployment.
- Config/ is encrypted.

**deploy/templates**

This folder holds the main code of the Server and Cli.

It has many templates that show how to run the system as a single binary or as many binaries on many machines in order to scale the system out.

If you look at maintemplatev2 you see our common patterns:

- cli-commands.go contains all instantiation code for loading the cli and all the sub modules.
- server_commands.go contains all instantiation code for loading the server and all the sub modules.
- bootstrap-data/ holds the template used to bootstrap data.
- client/ holds the main flutter client that then loads all the sub modules 
- config/ holds the configs for the sub modules.
- main/ holds the primary boot code of the Server and sdk-cli . It calls the server_commands.go and cli-commands.go respectivly.
- wrapper/ holds some shared util code that all the above uses.

See the README for each template to see how to build and run the code.
